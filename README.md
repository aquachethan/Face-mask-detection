 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is causing a global health crisis so the effective protection methods are wearing a face mask in public areas. 
The COVID-19 pandemic forced governments across the world to impose lockdowns to prevent virus transmissions. Reports indicate that wearing facemasks while at work clearly reduces the risk of transmission. 
An efficient and economic approach to using AI to create a safe environment in a manufacturing setup. A model using machine learning for face mask detection will be presented.
 A face mask detection dataset consists of with mask and without mask images, we are going to use OpenCV. We will use the dataset to build a COVID-19 face mask detector using Python, OpenCV, and Tensor Flow, and Keras. 
Our goal Is to identify whether the person on an image/video is wearing a face mask or not with the help of and deep learning.
